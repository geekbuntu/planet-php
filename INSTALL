INSTALLATION
************


- get it from http://github.com/chregu/planet-php/

- cp inc/config.inc.php-dist to inc/config.inc.php

- adjust the dsn parameter (and other config options if you want)

- make tmp directory writeable for the webserver

- import the db from div/db/mysql.sql

- add feeds to feeds table

- to import the entries (and populate the blogs table),
  run the ./libs/scripts/aggregate.php script

- open the page ;)

- Administration has to be done via phpMyAdmin (or similar), just add your
  RSS feeds to the feeds table. The rest should be done automatically.
